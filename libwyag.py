# This project we are writing our own git. 
# Basically I am just implementing this : https://wyag.thb.lt/
# Implementing is a 'big' word, just suplicating the above thing is more 
# accurate description. But I will not just copy-paste. I will type out the commands.
# I am confident I will learn a lot while doing this.
